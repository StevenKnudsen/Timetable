This interactive web application is developed using the SpringBoot framework, built on top of the Java platform. It offers two significant functionalities:

+ Visualizer: Showcasing a comprehensive diagram, it highlights the various program sequences available in engineering programs at the University of Alberta.

+ Scheduler: Apart from visualization, the application empowers students to craft their academic schedule. With the convenience of dragging and dropping courses, students can effortlessly design their educational trajectory.
